// ring, which is blit onto the main canvas on top of everything drawn so far.
//
// This MUST be called from inside render()'s own X.save()/scale(ZOOM)/
// X.restore() block — i.e. call sites, drawUnit/drawBuilding themselves, and
// this function all need to agree on which side of that transform they're
// operating on. Every position here is computed exactly the way drawUnit/
// drawBuilding compute theirs: logical (unscaled) pixels, ZOOM never
// multiplied in manually. That's deliberate, not an oversight — an earlier
// version of this drew the ring AFTER X.restore() (outside the transform)
// and re-applied ZOOM by hand, which sounds equivalent but isn't: the real
// sprite's position gets Math.round()'ed BEFORE the canvas scales it by
// ZOOM (round-then-scale, since it's drawn inside the transform), while the
// manual version rounded AFTER multiplying by ZOOM (scale-then-round).
// Those two only agree when camX/camY land on exact integers, which is
// rare during scrolling/following — the rest of the time the ring would
// drift up to half a zoom-level's worth of pixels off the sprite, in a
// different direction every frame as the camera moves. That drift is what
// "glitchy" was: not a buffer-management bug, a coordinate-space mismatch.
// Once both the sprite and its ring are positioned by the SAME transform,
// they can't disagree — so this needs no manual ZOOM math at all, only
// dpr (device pixel ratio, for crisp buffers on retina screens), which is
// an orthogonal concern from gameplay zoom.
